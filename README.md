# scraper
Part 1 of BotBE

Takes Chetham's [Belle Vue archive](http://www.chethams.org.uk/bellevue/), extracts the images and text from it, and puts metadata into a database.

We are using [scraPy](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html). 

Edit code in bellevue/spiders/bv-spider.py to configure.
