# scraper
Part 1 of BotBE

Takes Chetham's [Belle Vue archive](http://185.121.204.150/ChethamLibrary/#/search?TitCollectionTitle=Belle%20Vue%20Gardens), extracts the images and text from it, and puts metadata into a database.

Since this site has dynamic content, we are using [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/) and [Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/).
